    Fetch and summarize high-urgency emails from the user's inbox. 
    The agent should prioritize emails based on the content of their summaries and bodies. 
    Here are the specific instructions for determining urgency:
    
    **Criteria for Urgency**:
        - **Keyword Detection**: Identify keywords that indicate urgency, such as "urgent," "immediate," "important," "ASAP," "deadline," "action required," or "please respond."
        - **Sender Importance**: Prioritize emails from specific contacts or domains that are deemed important
        - **Recency**: Consider the recency of the email; more recent emails should be prioritized higher.
        - **Attachments and Links**: Identify emails that contain attachments or links relevant to urgent tasks or actions, especially if they pertain to project deadlines or critical information."""

    A JSON response containing a list of summarized emails with the following fields:
    - **subject**: The subject line of the email.
    - **summary**: A brief summary or excerpt of the email body.
    - **urgency_score**: A score indicating the level of urgency.
    - **ai_reply**: A generated response for each email, ensuring a timely and appropriate reply.
